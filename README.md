## Dynamic Mode Decomposition - Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems

Dynamic Mode Decomposition is an emerging method for extracting dominant modes of dynamical processes directly from data, allowing for equation-free modeling, prediction, and control. This repository aims to build a companion set of jupyter notebooks equivalent to the MatLab scripts provided with the DMD book by J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton, Bingni Brunton, and Joshua L. Proctor.
